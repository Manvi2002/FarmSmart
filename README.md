*🌾 FarmSmart – Crop Recommendation System*
FarmSmart is a Machine Learning-based project that helps farmers select the most suitable crops based on environmental and soil parameters. By leveraging data science, this system provides smart crop suggestions to increase yield and support informed agricultural decisions.

🚀 Features
🔍 Predicts the best-suited crop for a given region

🌱 Considers factors like soil type, temperature, humidity, rainfall

🧠 Uses supervised machine learning models

🌍 Aims to improve agricultural practices through smart farming

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Scikit-learn(for ML models)

Pandas, NumPy (data preprocessing)

📂 Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:

N (Nitrogen)

P (Phosphorous)

K (Potassium)

Temperature

Humidity

pH

Rainfall

Target: Crop label

⚙️ How It Works
Input environmental parameters (e.g., soil nutrients, rainfall)

ML model processes the data

System outputs the most suitable crop recommendation

🧪 Model Training
Preprocessed and normalized data

Trained using classification models like Random Forest

Evaluated with accuracy, confusion matrix

👨‍🌾 Use Case
FarmSmart empowers farmers by simplifying the crop selection process using data science. It helps reduce crop failure risk and supports sustainable agriculture.
